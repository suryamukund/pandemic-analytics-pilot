# Pandemic Analytics Pilot

This project explores how open data and analytics can be used for **pandemic preparedness** and **outbreak risk forecasting**.  
It is a pilot framework intended as an early step toward PhD research in **public health analytics**.

## Objectives
- Forecast COVID-19 case trends using open data.
- Explore correlations between mobility, climate, and outbreak risk.
- Provide a reproducible framework for rapid extension to other diseases.

## Data Sources
- COVID-19 cases: Our World in Data
- Mobility: Google Community Mobility Reports
- Climate: NOAA Climate Data

## Methods
- Time series forecasting (Prophet, ARIMA)
- Correlation analysis
- Visualization of outbreak risks

## Results
- Short-term COVID-19 forecasts (US, global)
- Outbreak risk heatmaps (planned)

*This repo is part of my research preparation for applying to PhD programs in the US (2026 cohort).*
